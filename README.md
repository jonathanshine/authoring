## External Link
   - [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com) was my favorite website for useful tips and tricks, with an emphasis on tech, but recently it's become more and more commercial
   - Well it seems this exercise actually asked me to link to [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/en) instead, so there you go!

## Images
   - This is a romanticized picture of coding to show how hip and relevant I am! _Sorry for the size!_

## Emojis
   - Since I tend to make a lot of embarrassing mistakes<sup>1</sup>, my most used emoji is :grimacing:
