# GitHub Flavored Markdown

- External Links
- Images
- Emojis

## External Link

- [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com) was my favorite website for useful tips and tricks, with an emphasis on tech, but recently it's become more and more commercial
- Well it seems this exercise actually asked me to link to [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/en) instead, so there you go!

## Images

- This is a romanticized picture of coding to show how hip and relevant I am! _Sorry for the size!_

## Emojis

- Since I tend to make a lot of embarrassing mistakes<sup>1</sup>, my most used emoji is :grimacing:

<sup>1</sup> _See External Link, Section 1: evidence of embarrassing mistake._

### Tables and Checkboxes

Let's convert our list to a table:

| Name | Done (y/n) |
| :---:   | :---: |
| External Links | y |
| Images | y |
| Emojis | y |

And here it is as a checkbox list:

- [x] External Links
- [x] Images
- [x] Emojis

Last, but not least, let's try a checkbox in a table :astonished::

| Name | Done? |
| :---:   | :---: |
| External Links | &#9745; |
| Images | &#9745; |
| Emojis | &#9745; |
